    <p>Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning
      after HTML. While HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content,
      CSS is used to style it and lay it out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font,
      color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations
      and other decorative features.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Learning_pathway">
    <header>Learning pathway</header>
    <p>You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We
      recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first.
      In that module, you will learn about:</p>

     <ul>
       <li>CSS, starting with the Introduction to CSS module</li>
       <li>More advanced HTML modules</li>
       <li>JavaScript, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages</li>
     </ul>
 <p>Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn
HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth between the two topics.
This is because HTML is far more interesting and much more fun to learn when you
apply CSS, and you can't really learn CSS without knowing HTML.</P>

<p>Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using computers and using
  the web passively (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a
  basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software and understand
  how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files — both of which are
  parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before proceeding
   with this topic. However, doing so isn't absolutely necessary as much of what is covered
   in the CSS basics article is also covered in our CSS first steps module, albeit in a lot
   more detail.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="What_is_CSS_for?">
     <header>What is CSS for?</header>
     <p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents
         are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
     <p>A <strong>document</strong> is usually a text file structured using a markup
       language — HTML is the most common markup
       language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as
       SVGor XML.</p

      <p><strong>Presenting</strong> a document to a user means converting it
        into a form usable by your audience. Browsers,like Firefox,Chrome, or Edge, are
        designed to present documents visually,for example, on a computer screen,
        projector or printer.</p>

    <header>Use CSS</header>
    <p>There are 3 ways to use CSS</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inline CSS</li>
      <li>Internal CSS</li>
      <li>External CSS</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Inline CSS</H3>
    <pre>
     <code>&lt;button style="color: purple"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;</code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Internal CSS</h3>
    <p>In your HTML file inside the head tag you should put the style tag:</P>
    <pre>
     <code>&lt;style&gt;
         button {
           color: purple;
         }
     &lt;/style&gt;</code>
    </pre>

    <p>And then you can have a button on your page</P>
      <pre>
       <code>&lt;button&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;</code>
      </pre>


    <h3>External CSS</h3>
    <p>In another CSS file we can have:</p>
    <pre>
     <code>button {
         color: purple;
       }</code>
    </pre>

    <p>And then import it into the HTML using the link tag</P>
      <pre>
       <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"/&gt;</code>
      </pre>

  <section class="main-section" id="Modules">
    <header>Modules</header>
    This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them.
    You should definitely start with the first one.

    <h3>CSS first steps</h3>
    <p>to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple
columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle
beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax
looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>

    <h3>CSS building blocks</h3>
    <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity
with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, its time
to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector
types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>

    <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you
understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like
text styling and CSS layout.</p>

    <h3>Styling text</h3>
    <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate
on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text
styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop
shadows and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to
your page, and styling lists and links.</p>

    <h3>CSS layout</h3>
    <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and
how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time
to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport,
and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep
into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox,
CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Solving_common_CSS_problems">
    <header>Solving common CSS problems</header>
    <p>Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections of content explaining
    how to use CSS to solve very common problems when creating a web page.</p>

    <p>From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and their backgrounds;
    change the size, shape, and position of elements; and add and define borders on elements.
    But there's not much you can't do once you have a solid understanding of even the basics of
    CSS. One of the best things about learning CSS is that once you know the fundamentals,
    usually you have a pretty good feel for what can and can't be done, even if you don't
    actually know how to do it yet!</p>

    <h3>CSS on MDN</h3>
    <p>The main entry point for CSS documentation on MDN, where you'll find detailed reference
   documentation for all features of the CSS language. Want to know all the values a property
   can take? This is a good place to go.</P>
